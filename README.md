## Todo

- [*] Convert to typescript
- [ ] Add support for multiple sources (e.g. animes and manga)
- [ ] Add support for multiple formats (e.g. mp4, mkv, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for multiple qualities (e.g. 720p, 1080p, etc.)
- [ ] Better search functionality (e.g. search by title, year, etc.) - maybe pagination

Let's hope I don't get banned or something.
And I don't know why I didn't make this in typescript.
